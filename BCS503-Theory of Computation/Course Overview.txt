Theory of Computation (BCS503) is a 4-credit core course designed to provide students with a strong foundational understanding of the mathematical principles underlying computation. The course explores formal languages, automata theory, computability, and complexity theory—key pillars that determine what problems can be solved by machines and how efficiently they can be solved.
Through structured pedagogy spanning 50 hours, the course introduces deterministic and nondeterministic computational models, regular and context-free grammars, Turing machines, decidability, and time/space complexity classes. Students develop the ability to analyze computational problems rigorously and reason about the capabilities and limitations of algorithms.
The course evaluation consists of 50 CIE marks and 50 SEE marks, totaling 100 marks, with an exam duration of 3 hours. By the end of the course, learners gain a deep conceptual understanding required for advanced study in compiler design, algorithm analysis, and formal verification.
